# Splataction Scene

A project in REAPER in which a scene from the movie *War Horse* is overdubbed with sound effects and music from the *Splatoon* video game series.  

## Files

- **Splatoon-Firefight.RPP** – REAPER project file  
- **Sources/** – A folder containing all audio and video source files  
- **Final Project Source.pdf** – A file containing citations for all sound effects used in the project  
- **README.md** – This lovely documentation you're reading now  

### **Important File Note**

The video file **Sources/WarHorse.mp4** may be missing due to it being too large for GitHub. In the event that it is, *before* opening the REAPER project, [it can be downloaded here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JuwJmSem0vOkpOGD8EA5Cn4TST62TDVV/view?usp=share_link) and placed back in the **Sources/** folder.  

Yes, I am well aware that the only person likely to have this repository would have gotten it from us directly and the missing file would be included, but I felt that it was worth mentioning.
